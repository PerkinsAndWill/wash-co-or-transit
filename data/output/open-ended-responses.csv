114242312465,30,Is there anything else you'd like to share about transit in Washington County?,Is there anything else you'd like to share about transit in Washington County?,Open-Ended Response,"Spending money for Max expansion is very wasteful in that the rails dictate where the trains will go, period.  With dedicated bus lanes. construction costs are reduced due to less concern with steepness of slope for operation with busses. Much more flexibility and reliability is available with dedicated bus lanes which can be utilized for local as well as station to station transit.  Electric busses will reduce the emissions as well as any electric, track tethered machinery.  All major routes requiring construction should exclusively be dedicated bus only lanes.  The Willamette Valley was once served by a complex and very complete electric railway service for freight and passengers.  The service died because of increased convenience when automobiles and roads became available.  We need to use convenience to attract greater mass transit bus ridership."

I live 2.5miles away. The closest bus stop to my house is half a mile away, and the nearest max stop is 1 mile. I do not want to be walking a mile or more a day, while I already walk all day at work over 10,000 steps, while i have foot, hip, and knee issues, it would be too much for me. I would also prefer the max line, but there is no bus to get me from home to the max. It takes me 7-8 minutes to drive to work in my car, but takes over 30 if i were to use public transportation because of the walking. I also find that anytime i want to use it outside of work, like for events, outings, getting to the airport, etc., it is never running late hours. I use the Subway, BART, Marta and other public transit options when i travel in other large cities, and by far the Trimet website is the most difficult to figure out and un user friendly, so havent even attempted to take it since i moved into the city recently because I can never easily figure out the schedule or nearest stops, etc. You also cant search my phones map app for words like ""trimet"" or ""max"", to point you in direction of nearest station, you have to know exact name of the stop. and if you look at the trimet provided map, its not laid out on a city map, so you cant look at street names etc that the stops might be on."

I'm really sick and tired of dealing with motor vehicles speeding, running stop signs/lights, noise, etc. Every part of life in WashCo is dominated by motor vehicles, and increasingly larger and more aggressive ""muscle trucks"". In my part of Hillsboro, the area I walk daily, there is virtually no intersection where a pedestrian or cyclist has NOT been hit. What can I say other than it feels pretty unsafe having to cross so many streets and never knowing how fast that vehicle is moving or if it will stop for that sign/light. Pedestrianism in WashCo is an afterthought. We build large developments without transit access and previously without sidewalks! Why? Because only private vehicles matter in WashCo. We close off easy access to transit near new developments and expect pedestrians to walk five times the distance and call this ""good planning"". Bah. The only thing that moves people from their self-driven vehicles to other forms of transportation is when it becomes 'too expensive' to drive/park."

114244416818,30,Is there anything else you'd like to share about transit in Washington County?,Is there anything else you'd like to share about transit in Washington County?,Open-Ended Response,"Improving mass transit is a great idea, but don't sacrifice single-occupancy vehicle drive times and parking to achieve the mass transit goals. The region's history of expanding housing in large, single-occupancy neighborhoods means car traffic will remain a large and essential mode.     Remember also that a large number of trips are not related to work commutes. It's difficult to conceive of a mass-transit solution that accommodates the needs of families that live 3 miles from the nearest grocery store and who have their children involved in extra-curricular activities scattered around the region.     For situations where mass transit can be improved, please remember the importance of park-and-ride lots. An example of where this was neglected is WES: WES would probably have much greater ridership if, for example, there were a several-story parking garage next to the Beaverton Transit Center (or more substantial park-and-ride options coupled with very frequent light rail schedule service). Extending WES-like transit along TV highway with improved connections at a safe BTC would also help, as would having the southern terminus of WES be a more substantial center than Wilsonville, such as Salem and beyond. I know that this latter concept conflicts with the latest plan for high-speed Amtrak service in the Willamette Valley, but unfortunately that plan short-changes everything to the west of I-5."

My biggest concern and reason for not wanting to use public transit anymore (in my specific situation I am mostly talking about the MAX) is safety and rider experience. There have been countless times where I feel uncomfortable due to behavior on the train or individuals who are displaying erratic or unsafe behavior, and disregard for other people's right to a pleasant ride. I've seen nudity on the MAX due to someone who was seemingly unaware that their pants were falling down. I've had individuals struggling with addiction get in my face and not listen to me when I ask them to back up. Unfortunately, some MAX riders (who I am assuming are experiencing homelessness) are struggling with personal hygiene and make an entire car essentially be unusable due to the smell. These are sad and unfortunate situations and I hope Washington County can find an equitable way to address these issues because it's not ideal for anyone. Again, thank you for the work you are doing."

114247571025,30,Is there anything else you'd like to share about transit in Washington County?,Is there anything else you'd like to share about transit in Washington County?,Open-Ended Response,"Yes. The buses deserve priority, epsicially on busier corridors. Having bus lanes on TV highway, murray blvd, 99W, Scholls Ferry, and other busy arterials is much needed. In addition to the bus lanes, signal queue jumpers should be installed to detect incoming buses and let them pass before other traffic, giving priority to the mode that moves the most people efficiently. These treatments would speed up travel times and provide incentive for more people to use transit. In addition, law enforcement officers and/or bus lane cameras should be placed along these routes to make sure the bus lanes are not used by motorists, otherwise the benefits to travel times will not be seen."

WAKE UP to the safety issues ON the trains--it feels unsafe to be on them even during rush hour times, let alone any time when it's dark!!  It isn't quite as bad on the buses because at least the driver is there in the bus with you and can call for help is there are safety issues (and they can stop anywhere to let people off the bus if there is a bad incident onboard). I have to ride Max for my transit--taking buses would be over a 2 hour commute. That is unacceptable, and I SHOULD be able to ride Max and feel relatively safe--that has not been the case for the past 3-4 years. That is sad and very frustrating, especially since the city of Beaverton pays for employees annual transit passes. I haven't used it for a couple of years due to safety concerns (the safety does not concern the virus--it's all about feeling safe and not constantly threatened while on board.  Also, the last time I rode Max (2021), the train was absolutely filthy and smelled terrible. There was trash all over the floor and seats, and it was hard to find a clean seat to occupy. This also turns people away from riding the Max trains. They have become disgusting."

I quit using transit due to crime, vagrancy, cleanliness, unreliability, and slow travel times from Hatfield to downtown Portland (too many stops). I won't use public transportation until these issues are resolved. I've used public transportation all over the world and the Portland area seems to have the among the biggest problems with fair enforcement, cleanliness, anti-social behavior, vandalism and safety. I suggest focusing on improving efficiency for commuters and improving rider comfort/experience rather than nebulous equity goals. You can create good policy around equal access and opportunity but you often end up trying to solve the wrong problems by structuring solutions around equity. Good luck - I want Transit to succeed in Washington County and the Portland area in general but you have a very long road ahead of you to just get back to where is was before 2018.

I myself, have been harassed and yelled at multiple times, for doing nothing other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time... These incidents happened in situations where there was no ability for the driver to know or to intervene, and led to the direct choice to abstain (and completely re-direct my transportation choices) for a good 6 months after each incident. It is not good nor safe for people to be yelled at, harassed, and screamed at with targeted words of hate, while riding the bus or max trains while using the trimet system. In Oregon of all places, I should expect to be treated kindly while riding the bus, and not harassed for my appearance or the appearance of the child passenger I am riding with. (One incident happened as a targeted harassment from an unhoused woman, who was saying homophobic slurs about me and my child, while we were riding the bus, because my child had a closely cropped haircut, while dealing with some ongoing health issues. The other rider had ZERO reason to say the unkind slurs she did, and I had no choice but to remove myself and my child from the bus, at the next available stop. There was no way to notify the driver, as we were at the back of the bus, and the crazy lady stayed on the bus and continued yelling at us, even after we had gotten up to get off the bus.)"
